    <h1>Fucking</h1>
    <p><b>Fugging</b>, formerly called Fucking (German: [ˈfʊkɪŋ] (About this soundlisten); officially renamed in 2021), is an Austrian village in the municipality of <b>Tarsdorf</b>, located in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria. The village is 33 kilometres (21 mi) north of Salzburg and 4 km (2.5 mi) east of the Inn river, which forms part of the German border.

        Despite having a population of only 106 in 2020, the village has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its former name, which was spelled the same as an inflected form of the profane English-language word "fuck".[1][2] Its road signs were a popular visitor attraction, and were often stolen by souvenir-hunting vandals until 2005, when they were modified to be theft-resistant. The name change to Fugging, which is pronounced the same in the local dialect, was rejected in 2004 but passed in late 2020.[3][4]</p>
